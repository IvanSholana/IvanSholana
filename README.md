## 👨‍💻 Who am I?

I’m a final year Computer Science student from Telkom University (a.k.a. Hogwarts for Code Wizards 🪄), specializing in data science and machine learning.  
Currently casting spells as a **Data Science Intern** at **PT Pupuk Indonesia** 🌾 and building tech-driven rehab magic at **Unsmoke** 💨.

In my free time, I pretend to be a GDSC mentor, develop Gen-AI-powered apps, help students debug their destinies (and Python code 🐍), and sometimes sleep.

> 🧠 “Sleep is for the weak” — me, before debugging a time series model for the 100th time.
